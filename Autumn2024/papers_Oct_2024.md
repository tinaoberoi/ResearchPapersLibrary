- **Abstract**: Determination of molecular energetics and properties is one of the core challenges in the near-term quantum computing. To this end, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are preferred for Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) architectures. The Projective Quantum Eigensolver (PQE) is one such algorithms that optimizes the parameters of the chemistry-inspired unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz using a conventional coupled cluster-like residual minimization. Such a strategy involves the projection of the Schrodinger equation on to linearly independent basis towards the parameter optimization, restricting the ansatz is solely defined in terms of the excitation operators. This warrants the inclusion of high-rank operators for strongly correlated systems, leading to increased utilization of quantum resources. In this manuscript, we develop a methodology for determining the generalized operators in terms of a closed form residual equations in the PQE framework that can be efficiently implemented in a quantum computer with manageable quantum resources. Such a strategy requires the removal of the underlying redundancy in high-rank excited determinants, generated due to the presence of the generalized operators in the ansatz, by projecting them on to an internally contracted lower dimensional manifold. With the application on several molecular systems, we have demonstrated our ansatz achieves similar accuracy to the (disentangled) UCC with singles, doubles and triples (SDT) ansatz, while utilizing an order of magnitude fewer quantum gates. Furthermore, when simulated under stochastic Gaussian noise or depolarizing hardware noise, our method shows significantly improved noise resilience compared to the other members of PQE family and the state-of-the-art variational quantum eigensolver.

- **Title**: [p-SWAP: A Generic Cost-Effective Quantum Boolean-Phase SWAP Gate Using Two
CNOT Gates and the Bloch Sphere Approach]([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16641))

- **Abstract**: A generic Boolean-phase SWAP gate is introduced for quantum cost-effectiveness. This gate is termed the “p-SWAP”, and p is a customizable phase difference between the swapped qubits, where 0 ≤ p ≤ ± π radians. The cost-effectiveness of p-SWAP gate comes from a lower quantum cost for its final transpiled quantum circuit into a real quantum computer. The p-SWAP gate only utilizes two Feynman (CNOT) gates, as compared to the standard SWAP gate constructed from three CNOT gates. The quantum circuit of p-SWAP gate is geometrically designed using our Bloch sphere approach. The generality of p-SWAP gate is proposed for Phase oracles requiring a desirable p for a combination set of swapped qubits, as well as for Boolean oracles requiring a cost-effective SWAP gate when p is ignored. In this paper, after transpilation (synthesization) into a real quantum computer, it was concluded that the transpiled quantum circuit of p-SWAP gate has a lower quantum cost than that of the standard SWAP gate.
