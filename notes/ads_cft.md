# ADS CFT correspondence

one of the most concrete tools available to study quantum gravity. Since it provides a mapping between a gravity theory in AdS space and a well-understood quantum field theory on the boundary, it **allows physicists to use the known mathematics of quantum field theory to explore the mysteries of quantum gravity**.
