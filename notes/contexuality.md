# Contexuality

concept that highlights the difference between classical and quantum reasoning about physical systems. It refers to the idea that outcome of quantum measurment can depend on context. - that is, on which other compatible measurments are being performed simulatenously. This is in stark contrast to classical physics, where measurement outcomes are determined by pre-existing properties of the system and are independent of the measurement setup.

## Classical intution and Non-contexuality
<hr>
In classical physics:

- Properties of a system (e.g., position, momentum) are well-defined, independent of measurement.
- Measurement simply reveals these pre-existing properties.
- A non-contextual hidden variable theory assumes that the result of a measurement is determined by intrinsic properties of the system, independent of how the measurement is performed or what other measurements are conducted alongside it.

For example:

In a classical system, the color of an object doesn't depend on whether you're measuring its shape at the same time.

## Classical intution and Non-contexuality

Quantum mechanics challenges this classical intuition:

- Measurement outcomes are not determined by pre-existing properties alone. Instead, they depend on the entire measurement context.
- Contextuality means that a quantum observable's value is not an absolute property of the system but can vary based on which other observables are measured concurrently.

Key Example: The Kochen-Specker Theorem

The Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem rigorously proves that quantum mechanics is contextual:

- Consider a quantum system where measurements are represented by operators acting on a Hilbert space (e.g., spin or polarization measurements).
- The theorem shows that it is impossible to assign fixed, pre-determined values (0 or 1) to all possible measurements in a way that satisfies quantum predictions and the relationships between those measurements.
- This means that the result of a measurement depends on the "context"‚Äîthe set of other compatible measurements performed alongside it.

Example in Spin Systems:

For a spin- $\frac{1}{2} particle, measuring spin along the ùëß-axis (eigenstates of 
$S_z$ may yield values of $¬±\frac{‚Ñè}{2}$.

The outcome of a spin measurement along x or y-axes cannot be predetermined independently of which axis is measured. The act of measurement creates a specific context that influences the result.
